A sleek, responsive memory game built with React and TypeScript. Test your memory by finding pairs of matching emojis!
🚀 Features

    State-Driven Logic: Uses React hooks (useState, useEffect) to manage game flow and card transitions.

    Smooth Animations: 3D CSS card-flip effects (optional/planned).

    Smart Guard Clauses: Prevents double-clicking the same card or clicking more than two cards at once.

    Asynchronous Gameplay: Implements a 1-second "peek" window when cards don't match using setTimeout.
